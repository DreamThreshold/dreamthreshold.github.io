<ul>
      <li> Uploaded data will persist through page refreshes (javascript session storage), but not page closes. </li>
      <li> Data remains in your browser and is not sent anywhere. In fact, this app works without any internet connection if you download it locally! </li>
      </ul>`,

`<u>Hex Viewer</u><br> View hexadecimal data from game files. If viewing a processed set of data, such as decompressed or compressed data, you can download the data from the "â˜°" menu.<br>
    <ul>
      <li> Animating decompression: after uploading compressed data, go to the compressed data hex viewer's "â˜°" menu and click "Animate Decompression Process". This will play a visualization of the process, with data bytes given different shades to correspond to the compression mode used. More details on the compression scheme can be found <a href="#about_dkc1_compression">below</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  `,

  `<u>Bitplane Viewer</u><br> Visualize SNES 4 bit per pixel graphics tiles and their weird intertwined format.
    <ul>
      <li> Upload a file to "Input - Compressed Data" to get started. This expects a .bin file that you might get in a disassembly of the game, usually in the "graphics/compressed" folder. Or, copy the hex values from the relevant offset of your ROM to a new file.</li>
      <li> After uploading valid data, the bitplane diagram should appear, showing the first tile. In the diagram, you can see how the 32 bytes of data comprise the four bitplanes. Each pixel or "cell" of the 8x8 bitplane is stacked with those of the other bitplanes to form a color index of between 0 and 15 (0x0 to 0xF) for each pixel of the tile. For example, if the bitplanes read "1 0 1 0" from front to back for a given pixel, that pixel's index value will be "A".</li>
      <li> The bitplane diagram is a 3d model and can rotate when dragged. ctrl+scroll to zoom in or out.</li>
      <li> Click the "<" and ">" buttons near the top to flip through the tiles. Alternatively, if a tileset viewer panel is present, click a tile within that panel to show it in the bitplane viewer.</li>
    </ul>`,

  `<u>Palette Viewer</u><br> View color palettes used in the game's levels. Select a row of colors (16-color sub-palette) to assign it to the indexed tile in the bitplane viewer. 
    <br>(Currently uses the following forumla: 
    <br>SNES 5 bit color channel  Ã—  8  =  RGB 8 bit channel
    <br> ... there are multiple ways to convert the colors.)
    <br>You can download a PNG of the palette from the "â˜°" menu.<br>`,

  `<u>Tileset Viewer</u><br> View the 8x8 pixel tiles in their grayscale form, before they are assigned a color palette.
    <br>You can download a PNG of the tileset from the "â˜°" menu.<br>`,

  `<u>Metatiles Viewer</u><br> View 32x32 pixel metatiles. Each metatile is composed of 4x4 tiles, 16 total. Each of the metatiles is built using an associated color sub-palette, and potentially horizontal and/or vertical flip; hover to view these details. Requires graphics tiles, palette, and then tilemap32 to be uploaded. Make sure your tilemap32 matches your 8x8 tiles: for example, don't use a foreground/background tilemap on layer 3 tiles, or vice versa. Mainly meant for FG/BG.
    <br>You can download a PNG of the metatiles from the "â˜°" menu.<br>`,

  `<u>Level Map Viewer</u><br> View level maps built from the metatiles. Currently only supports horizontal levels (so, no water levels, yet). Requires graphics tiles, palette, tilemap32, and then level map to be uploaded.
    <br>Note that most "level maps" consist of all levels for a given archetype, like jungle levels, snow levels, etc. This includes bonus rooms.
    <br>The "background" color is currently set to color 0 of the tiles' sub-palettes, instead of true transparent.
    <br>You can download a PNG of the partial level map from the "â˜°" menu. Currently limited in width, for performance reasons.<br>`

<b>App Background</b><br>
  The app's first release was made to celebrate DKC's 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary. The goal is to de-mystify DKC hacking and to provide even more appreciation for what Rare developed in the 1990s. 
  <br><br>
  There exist multiple editors and resources for the DKC series, already (though, nowhere near the depth of resources for SMW and other games). But if you're curious about how all this stuff works, it's tricky to comb through the assorted resources online and wrap your head around things. At least for me it was :) I like being able to play around with stuff, look at it in different ways, dive into the unique aspects like the custom compression, and trace the pipeline of data. By putting those features in this app, I hope that sort of stuff can help other people more easily grasp DKC hacking as well. And, with a node-based user interface like this, I'm hoping people can find a good workflow for unconventional hacks in the future.
  <br><br>
  More features will continue to be added. Works best in a full screen window, tested most thoroughly with firefox. You can expect more features for visualizing, documenting, and hacking the DKC series soon. Thanks!
  <br><br>
  Special thanks to the DKC Atlas community members and their previous work. In particular Kingizor's dkcomp program. In the future I will update this page with additional guides and resources, and their proper credits.

`<span id="about_dkc1_compression"><b>DKC1 Compression</b></span><br>
  DKC1 uses a custom compression/decompression scheme. It consists of four possible modes:
  <ol>
    <li value="0"> Copy (basically, no compression)</li>
    <li value="1"> Run-length encoding (RLE)</li>
    <li value="2"> History (LZ-like)</li>
    <li value="3"> Lookup table (LUT)</li>
  </ol><br>
  Compressed graphics tilesets contain a 64-word (128-byte) lookup table, and then many variable-length spans/blocks of compressed data. Each span begins with a command byte. The first two bits specify the mode (0 to 3), and the remaining 6 bits are an operand (which we'll often call <i>n</i>), often used as a count number. Following the command byte, there are usually more data bytes (Depends on the mode). <br><br>
  Copy (mode 0) tells the decompressor to copy the next <i>n</i> bytes from input to output, verbatim. Not very efficient, obviously.<br><br>
  RLE (mode 1) tells the decompressor to take the next byte, and write it to output <i>n</i> times.<br><br>
  History (mode 2) tells the decompressor to take the next two bytes, swap them, and use this an an address within the <i>output</i> data from which to copy <i>n</i> bytes. This is similar to some LZ algorithms like LZ77, LZW, etc.<br><br>
  LUT (mode 3) tells the decompressor to multiply <i>n</i> by two, and use this as an address within the beginning of the input (the lookup table) from which to copy a word (two bytes) to output. 
  <br><br>
  The decompressor starts at offset 128 of the input data, and decodes each span of compressed bytes. Eventually we get to our complete, decompressed graphics tiles. 
  <br><br>
  DKC2 and 3 used more advanced and ostensibly more efficient compression algorithms. Those will be supported in this app in the future, as well.`,

`<b>App Background</b><br>
  The app's first release was made to celebrate DKC's 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary. The goals of this app are <br>
  <ul>
    <li>de-mystify DKC hacking through interactive visualizations and other resources</li>
    <li>provide editing tools in a new format, to spur creativity for DKC hacking</li>
    <li>provide appreciation for the DKC series as whole, especially Rare's work</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  More features will continue to be added. Works best in a full screen window. Tested most thoroughly with firefox; many features probably will not work in internet explorer and old browser versions. You can expect more features for visualizing, hacking, and documenting the DKC series (and more) soon. Thanks!
